# N queens quantum classical
In this project, I solved the N queens mathematical problem, which consists of arranging N queens in a NxN chessboard such that they do not threaten each other, using different classical, hybrid and quantum combinatorial optimization algorithms.

I worked on this project during a summer internship at Eviden (Atos group).
